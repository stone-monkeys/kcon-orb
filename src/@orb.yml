  kconnect is a CLI utility that can be used to discover and securely access Kubernetes clusters across multiple operating environments.

  Based on the authentication mechanism chosen the CLI will discover Kubernetes clusters you are allowed to access in a target hosting environment (i.e. EKS, AKS, Rancher) and generate a kubeconfig for a chosen cluster.

  As kconnect utilizes aws-iam-authenticator under the hood, please provide AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SESSION_TOKEN as Environment Variables in your Project Settings, or as a context.
